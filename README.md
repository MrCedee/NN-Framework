## Neural Network Framework from Scratch

This project is a Python-based neural network framework built entirely from scratch, designed to deepen understanding of machine learning and neural networks. The framework allows you to create, train, and evaluate neural networks with custom layers, activation functions, and training methods.

### Key Features:
- **Layer Customization:** Add and configure layers with various activation functions, including ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, and Linear.
- **Forward Propagation:** Implements the classic matrix formulation for calculating weighted sums (z) and outputs, essential for the forward pass in neural networks.
- **Backpropagation:** Includes backpropagation for updating weights and biases based on the calculated loss, optimizing the model over multiple epochs.
- **Loss and Metrics:** Built-in functions to calculate loss (MSE) and accuracy metrics for evaluating model performance.

### Use Cases:
- **Non-Linear Classification:** Tested on a custom non-linear point classification problem, showcasing the framework's ability to handle complex decision boundaries.
- **Iris Dataset:** Demonstrated performance on the classic Iris dataset, a standard benchmark in machine learning.

This framework serves as a learning tool and is not optimized for production use. However, it provides a clear and detailed implementation of core neural network concepts, making it a valuable resource for anyone looking to understand the inner workings of deep learning.

Feel free to explore the code, run the tests, and experiment with different network architectures!
